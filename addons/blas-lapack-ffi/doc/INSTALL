* Linux

You can check it out by

  git clone /prj/hss/huang/blas-lapack-ffi.git/


Currently, it only works on Linux x86-64 platform with Intel MKL.

Other platforms with other libraries should be easy to port but
corresponding knowledge are needed.



0) Prerequisite

  - install Intel MKL (this should add various env vars to the shell)
  - install C compiler (e.g., MSVC on windows, gcc on linux)


1) Usage

  - cd blas-lapack-ffi/src
  - make (currently it needs to build a .so wrapper)
  - cd blas-lapack-ffi/ or link .asd files to your project 
  - start lisp
  - (require :asdf) ; load asdf
  - (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :lapack)
  - ready to use (everything's in the msi.blas: and msi.lapack: packages)

2) Porting

  - src/Makefile (change gcc line)
  - change blas.asd (if you want to use other LAPACK libraries other
    than Intel's)
