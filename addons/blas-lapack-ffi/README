FFI definitions for BLAS and LAPACK. Currently only Intel MKL is
supported, but it's fairly easy to add more.

This package also contains other interesting stuff:

- a FFI supports fortran ABI (see src/ffi-utils.lisp)
- a wrapper and makefile to generate .so file for enable SMP in Intel MKL
  (see src/lapack_wrapper.*, src/Makefile)
- Some utilities for thread-safety (e.g. make-static-array)

BLAS/LAPACK manuals can be found at:

For other information you can find them in docs/.
